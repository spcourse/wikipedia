# Visualize GDP Per Capita

## Specification

Create a program named `visualize_gdp.py` that generates a histogram showing the distribution of GDP per capita from data collected in the previous assignment. Execute the program with the following command:

    python visualize_gdp.py gdp_per_capita.csv

The program should load the data into a Pandas DataFrame and use [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to create the histogram plot. The resulting plot should resemble the example below, but feel free to design it as simple or detailed as you prefer, as long as it clearly presents the histogram data. Save your plot as `gdp_barplot.png`.

Remember to exclude countries containing missing values (marked as `-1`) from your plot.
